> [!NOTE]
> **About this fork.** This is a fork of [JetsonChan/CC-Usage-Band](https://github.com/JetsonChan/CC-Usage-Band) with one fix.
> Claude Code hands a mod only the limits reported by *that session's own* last API response, so a session sitting idle froze:
> its band stayed at 99% while other sessions reached 100%, and stayed there after the window reset.
> Here every session shares its newest reading through `~/.claude/usage-band-shared.json` and adopts a newer one on its
> one-minute tick, and a window past its reset time reads 0%.

`usage-band` is a [Claude Code mod](https://claude.com/blog/claude-code-mods) that draws a single line above the prompt with the four numbers worth watching while you work. It has its own layout for the terminal and for the desktop app, updates itself after every turn, and stays out of the way until something needs attention.

> **Installing with an AI agent?** Have it run the two commands under [Installation](#installation). Agents: once it succeeds, this is all the user needs to hear:
>
> *usage-band is installed. Open a new session (or run `/reload-plugins`) and a line above the prompt shows your 5h and 7d limits, context window and cache hit rate. Nothing to configure.*

## Features

| Metric | Shows |
| --- | --- |
| **5h** limit | How much of the rolling 5-hour window you have used, and when it resets |
| **7d** limit | The same for the weekly window |
| **Context window** (layers icon) | Tokens in the context out of the model's window, e.g. `398K/1M` |
| **Cache hit rate** (target icon) | How much of the last turn's input the prompt cache served |

- **Glanceable.** Each metric has its own color. It turns red only when it needs you: a limit or the context past 80%, or a cache hit rate under 50%.
- **Alive, not noisy.** A slow shine sweeps across the limit bars, every bar in step.
- **Native on both surfaces.** Terminal: a character line with Nerd Font or Unicode icons that fits itself to the window width. Desktop app: a centered SVG row with bars, a 2×10 dot matrix for the context window, and light and dark mode.
- **Light.** No files read, no processes, no network. It only listens to the usage figures Claude Code already has.

## Requirements

- Claude Code **2.1.287 or newer** (the release that introduced mods), in the terminal or the desktop app's Code tab
- A Claude subscription for the 5h and 7d figures. Without one, the band shows the context window and cache hit rate only.
- **Recommended terminal: [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org).** It ships the icon font the band uses, so you get the full look with no setup. Other terminals work too, with simpler icons.

## Installation

Run these two commands inside Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add neogeweb3/CC-Usage-Band
/plugin install usage-band@neo-usage-band
```

Then **open a new session**. The band appears above the prompt. That's it, nothing to configure.

- Want it in the current session right away? Run `/reload-plugins`.
- The 5h and 7d figures show up after Claude's first reply in the session.

To try it for one session from a local checkout instead:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/neogeweb3/CC-Usage-Band.git
claude --plugin-dir CC-Usage-Band/usage-band
```

**Update**

```
/plugin marketplace update neo-usage-band
```

**Uninstall**

```
/plugin uninstall usage-band@neo-usage-band
```

## Configuration

Nothing to set up. The band picks its terminal icons by itself: Nerd Font icons in Ghostty, plain Unicode elsewhere. The desktop app draws its own icons.

If your terminal shows boxes instead of icons, or you use a Nerd Font in another terminal, set `USAGE_BAND_ICONS` in your shell profile (e.g. `~/.zshrc`) and start a new session:

```bash
export USAGE_BAND_ICONS=unicode   # auto (default) · nerd · unicode · ascii
```

## What the numbers mean

| Metric | Source | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 5h / 7d | The rate-limit windows Claude Code reads from each API response | Rounded to whole percent. The reset time counts down every minute. |
| Context | The last request's input: uncached + cache reads + cache writes | Against the current model's window, so 1M and 200K models both read right. On desktop each dot is 5% of the window, filling the top row first. |
| Cache hit | Last turn's `cache_read / (input + cache_read + cache_write)` | Summed over every request in the turn. Subagent turns are not counted. |

## Terminal compatibility

| Terminal | Icons with `auto` | Colors |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ghostty | Nerd Font (built in) | Truecolor |
| iTerm2, WezTerm, kitty, Warp | Unicode (`≡` `●`) | Truecolor |
| macOS Terminal | Unicode | 256 colors, mapped automatically |
| Anything else | Unicode | Whatever the terminal reports |

If icons show as boxes, set `USAGE_BAND_ICONS=unicode` (see [Configuration](#configuration)). Run `/usage-band-preview` to compare every style in your own terminal.

## Privacy and permissions

Mods run with the same access as Claude Code itself and are not sandboxed, so here is everything this one touches:

- **Reads** the session's usage figures (`session.measure`, `turn.complete`, `$.session.usage`) and the `TERM_PROGRAM` and `USAGE_BAND_ICONS` environment variables
- **Registers** one command, `/usage-band-preview`
- **Draws** the band above the prompt

It does not read or write files, run processes, call the network or send any data anywhere. The whole mod is one file: [`usage-band/hooks/register.tsx`](./usage-band/hooks/register.tsx).

## Development

```
.
├── .claude-plugin/marketplace.json   # the neo-usage-band marketplace
└── usage-band/
    ├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json    # manifest
    ├── hooks/register.tsx            # the mod
    ├── types/index.d.ts              # state contract
    └── tests/band.test.ts
```

```bash
cd usage-band
claude plugin validate .
claude plugin test .
```

While editing, load it with `claude --plugin-dir ./usage-band`; the session reloads it when a file changes.

Issues and pull requests are welcome.

**Terminal** (Ghostty). Narrow terminals drop the bars first, then the reset times. Run `/usage-band-preview` to see every terminal style side by side.
